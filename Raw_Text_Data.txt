Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture concerned with animals that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, or other products. It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding, and the raising of livestock. Animal husbandry refers to livestock raising and selective breeding. It is the management and care of animals in which the genetic qualities and behavior of animals are further developed for profit. A large number of farmers depend upon animal husbandry for their livelihood.
Animals provide us with a variety of food products which have high nutritional values. Therefore, they require a lot of care and attention. Animals are bred commercially in order to meet the high demand for food. Dairy products from animals like cows, buffaloes, goats, are rich sources of protein. These animals are called milch animals as they provide us with milk. Another set of animals that provide nutrient-rich food are hen, ducks, goose, etc. They provide us with eggs, which again are rich sources of protein. Animals like chicken, duck, ox, goat, pigs, etc. are bred for meat. Other than these domestic animals we have other sources of nutrients as well, they are marine animals. The seafood we eat has very high nutrient values. They are sources of a variety of nutrients like fat, proteins, vitamins and minerals.
 The animals are bred, cared, reared and sheltered in a farm or region, which are specially built for them. Animal husbandry involves poultry, milk-farms, apiculture (bee agriculture), aquaculture, etc.

Animal husbandry has the following advantages:Animal husbandry helps in the proper management of animals by providing proper food, shelter and protection against diseases to domestic animals. It provides employment to a large number of farmer and thereby increases their living standards. It helps in developing high yielding breeds of animals by cross breeding. This increases the production of various food products such as milk, eggs, meat, and others. It involves the proper disposal of animal waste and promotes a healthy environment.

There are four major types of animal husbandry practiced in the world today they include Dairy Farming, Poultry Farming, Fish Farming


Animal husbandry is beneficial to human beings in the following ways:
Dairy Products: Animals such as cows, goats, sheep, etc. are the major source of milk and milk products such as yoghurt, cheese, butter, etc.Meat: Animals such as cows, buffaloes, pigs, and goats are reared for their meat. Their meat is a rich source of dietary protein. Land Management: The livestock is sometimes grazed to control the growth of weeds on agricultural land. The dry shrubs in the areas that are prone to wildfire are eaten by goat and sheep, which reduces the risk of fire.
Fiber: Animals also produce fibers or textiles such as wool and leather. For eg, sheep are reared for wool whereas leather can be obtained from camel. Manure: The excreta, blood and bones of animals are used as manure. The manure is spread on the fields to increase the crop yields and crop production. It is also used as fuel for fires and as plaster for walls and floor. Labor: Animals are a source of non-human labor. They are used for ploughing fields, transporting goods and military functions. For ag., horses, yaks and donkeys are used for such purposes.

Apiculture
what is beekeeping:
apiculture or beekeeping is the care and management of honey bees for the production of honey and wax. Apiculture is the scientific method of rearing honeybees. Bees are one of the many insects in the world that can produce something that is beneficial to all of us. We obtain honey from these bees and as we all know, honey is an important food for human beings. Since ancient times, honey is used for treating several diseases, and it is an antioxidant, therefore beekeeping is an important activity. In a colony, there are 10,000 to 60,000 bees! But all of them do not collect nectar- there is a strict division of labour. The queen bee and female bees lay thousands of eggs. Larvae that hatch are fed royal jelly and the duration that they are fed will decide their role as a worker or queen. The drone bees are male and their job is only to help in fertilizing the eggs laid by the queen, and the worker bees do the actual work of collecting nectar.

The main advantages of beekeeping are: Provides honey, which is the most valuable nutritional food, Provides bee wax which is used in many industries, including cosmetics industries, polishing industries, pharmaceutical industries, etc. Bees Play an excellent role in pollination. Honey bees are the best pollinating agents which help in increasing the yield of several crops. According to the recent studies, the honey bee venom contains a mixture of proteins which can potentially be used as a prophylactic to destroy HIV that causes AIDS in humans.

What are the products obtained from apiculture: The main products obtained from apiculture are honey and wax. These products are used in cosmetic industries, polishing industries and pharmaceutical industries. Honey has medicinal values and is also used as a food additive.
How is apiculture done: Apiculture is the act of rearing honeybees. In this method, the bees are bred commercially in apiaries. Apiary is an area where a large number of beehives can be placed. Here, the bees are taken care of and managed to produce wax and honey.Apiculture is important for the following reasons such as : Apiculture provides products such as honey and wax that are used commercially, Honeybees are responsible for pollination and thus help in increasing the yield of the several plants, and Some recent researches have proven that honeybees venom comprises a mixture of proteins that has the capability of destroying the AIDS virus.

How are the bees divided in a beehive? What work does each of them do? : The bees are divided into queen, drone and worker. The queen bee lays thousands of eggs, the worker bee collects nectar and the drone bee fertilizes the eggs laid by the queen bee
The beekeepers rear only the following varieties of bees because only they can produce honey: Apis florea, Apis indica, Apis dorsata, and Apis mellifera.




Production options
There are several types of small-scale cattle enterprises. Generally, they are Grouped into three broad areas:
• Growing and feeding operations - In these operations, calves or yearlings are either raised or purchased and then are fed (fattened for slaughter). Included in this category are operations specializing in producing cattle for home use.
• Breeding herds - A breeding herd consists  of cows and bulls that are used to produce calves for sale as breeding or feeder animals.
• Combinations of growing, feeding, and breeding herds Success of your operation depends on adapting a strategy that fits your needs.After reviewing this publication and generating some ideas about what kind of operation you would like to have, contact your Extension agent and work out a detailed plan

Growing and feeding operations:
There are two main types of growing and feeding operations—steer/heifer operations and stocker (or backgrounding) operations. In a steer or heifer operation, you purchase 500- to 600-pound feeder calves after weaning at approximately 7 to 10 months of age. They can be fed out and marketed in less than a year from the time of purchase. Thus, the investment on each calf is returned within a comparatively short time. This type of operation may not require much land, but adequate  facilities are essential so that animals can be kept comfortable and under control. A stocker or backgrounding operation pastures or feeds calves until they reach 750 to 800 pounds. Then they are sold to a feedlot for finishing. Some excellent enterprises are solely pasture operations. Weaned calves or yearlings are purchased in early spring, go on pasture when the grass is ready, and are sold when the pasture season is over. On the other hand, calves cost less in the fall; therefore, depending on the cost of winter feed, fall may be the best time to purchase cattle for the next pasture season. In these calf and yearling enterprises, purchase price and selling price greatly influence profitability. It is recommended that you ask an experienced cattle buyer to assist in purchasing animals that best suit your type of operation, land, and resources

Managing newly purchased calves:
When you purchase calves for a growing or feeding operation, keep them in an area that allows you to observe them for 2 weeks. This enables you to prevent the spread of disease. Calves should have access to plenty of water and feed. Working the calves requires  a lot of patience, as they are easily excited  and stressed. Your veterinarian or Extension  agent can help you develop a health program that lowers the risk of disease for newly received calves.


Breeding herds:
Establishing a breeding herd is a long range program. It also requires more land than a simple steer or heifer feeding program. Consider how your available resources match your long-term objectives. There must be adequate feed, water, and fences to accommodate a year-round operation. Decide whether to have registered purebred cattle or commercial cattle. Income from a commercial beef herd comes mainly from the sale of calves and old or cull animals. Sale of breeding stock is the main source of income from registered cattle. Care and management of registered cattle is more intensive than for commercial cattle. Establishing a breeding herd is a longrange program.

Developing a registered herd:
If your objective is to raise registered cattle and supply breeding animals to other cattle producers, it may be necessary to make large capital investments in purebred stock. Development of a registered herd means that both the sire and dam must be purebred and registered with the same national breed association. You must keep accurate records and register the desirable Developing a registered herd If your objective is to raise registered cattle and supply breeding animals to other cattle producers, it may be necessary to make large capital investments in purebred stock. Development of a registered herd means that both the sire and dam must be purebred and registered with the same national breed association. You must keep accurate records and register the desirable

Developing a commercial herd:
The criteria for selection, or selling points, of good commercial cows depend on size, quality, age, condition, stage of pregnancy, and market price. You should select breed and cow size to match your feed resources and topography. Local ranchers or Extension personnel can give you an idea of what breeds are best suited to your area. Crossbreeding (mating animals from two or more breeds) can be an advantage in a commercial cow herd. Capitalizing on the merits of several breeds, plus the extra vigor from crossbred calves, may give you a competitive edge in the market. Remember that advances in genetic merit probably will not be realized for several years.

Managing a cow-calf herd
The major concern of cattle producers is profit. For a cow-calf herd, profits are determined by the percent calf crop (the number of calves weaned per cows bred), the weaning weight of the calves, the costs of maintaining breeding animals, and, ultimately, the sale price of the calves. Because your entire program depends on the fitness of the breeding animals, it is essential to maintain good herd health by not allowing the cattle to become too fat or too thin. Cows do not milk as well and may have problems calving or getting bred if they are overweight or underweight. Bulls that are not in good condition may perform poorly during the breeding season. See “Feeding beef cattle,” page 5, for information on nutritional needs of beef cattle


Breeding (mating):
It is ideal to have a controlled breeding season, rather than allowing the bull to run with the cows continuously. A 45- to 60-day breeding season is recommended.The resulting shortened calving season increases the possibility of having a uniform set of calves to sell at market time. Cattle of similar breeding and size usually bring more money. Another advantage is that you can concentrate your work with cows during calving into a short span, instead of having it strung out for months. Cattle have a 283-day gestation period. Select breeding dates so that cows will calve at the time of year you desire. Considerations in determining calving season include weather conditions and the ability to match feed resources with the cows’ requirements. For example, seasonal considerations for the Willamette Valley include the following: •	Late fall or winter calving usually is notdesirable because rain causes wet, muddy lots and pastures. The adverse weather may increase the incidence of calf scours and pneumonia.Late summer calving is a common prac-tice because of the ideal weather. However, you must feed a high-quality ration to nursing cows and calves during winter, when only harvested feeds are available. This greatly increases feed costs.
•	Calving in the spring allows the cows toutilize rapidly growing range and pasture, thus eliminating harvesting costs. However, spring calves may be too young to use all of the milk the cow provides as a result of the excellent nutrition she is receiving.

Calving:
This aspect of beef cattle management requires experience and skill. If you are inexperienced, it is recommended that you contact your veterinarian and/or Extension agent for advice on calving management. You can read further on this subject in the Cow-Calf Management Guide and Cattle Producer’s Library. One of the simplest ways to add to the value of your calves is to make sure they are well fed, properly castrated, dehorned, vaccinated, and clearly identified. The most important thing to remember when working calves is to stress them as little as possible. You can learn how to castrate, dehorn, and give vaccinations under the supervision of an experienced cattle producer or veterinarian. A good vaccination program also is vital to herd health and performance. Your Extension agent and veterinarian are good sources of information on this subject.

Weaning:
Weaning is accomplished by separating calves from their mothers. Calves should be weaned at approximately 7 to 8 months of age. This gives the cow time to regain body condition after nursing. Calves need an ample supply of fresh water and feed. Some producers prefer to creep feed (feed calves in an enclosure accessible only to the calves) prior to weaning. This may help encourage the calves to begin feeding on their own after weaning. Keeping performance records Keeping records enables you to cull poor performers and maintain good overall herd health and vigor. Examples of helpful calf records include birth weight, weaning weight, and average daily gain.

Facilities and equipment in Beef Farms:
Producing beef cattle on a small farm does not require elaborate or expensive housing or facilities. Under most weather conditions, cattle do very well outside.In the Pacific Northwest, cows need a mud-free area with protection from wind and rain. One method is to allow animals to have access to an open-air pole shelter. In an enclosed building, proper ventilation is important to maintain good health. Design facilities to make your job easy and safe and to minimize your expenditure of time and labor. An effective working facility consists of a corral with a narrow alley, a head catch, and a squeeze chute. The chute is needed for vaccinations, deworming, etc. The head catch is needed if you must aid a cow with calving. The corral and narrow alley help confine animals that need to be handled and driven into the chute or head catch. Well-designed handling facilities help to minimize animal confusion and stress. Poorly designed facilities increase stress on the animals and may cause poor performance, which can affect meat quality. Use of electric prods is not recommended because they cause animals unnecessary pain and stress. You can find more information on designing cattle facilities in the Management section of the Cow-Calf Management Guide and Cattle Producer’s Library. It is important to maintain the quality of feed. Store forages (including hay, straw, or silage) and grains in a dry building free from rodents. Forages lose nutritional value when exposed to direct sunlight. Wet hay loses feed value and palatability and presents a safety hazard due to combustion. Rodents can damage feed and spread disease. Feeders reduce waste and prevent the spread of many internal parasites and other cattle diseases. You can buy many kinds of manufactured feeders. Or, you can build them out of materials on hand. An adequate, year-round supply of clean, fresh water is basic to any successful cattle enterprise. Many types of water troughs are available from local feed or farm supply stores. You can recycle old barrels and bathtubs to make functional troughs; be sure to clean them thoroughly prior to use. Pens, feedlots, and corrals should be located at a convenient distance from feed storage facilities. These areas should be well drained, with drainage moving away from feed storage, working facilities, and roads. It is important to make these areas accessible to tractors for easy feeding and cleaning. Proper transportation is a must for your cattle. A 1-ton or 3⁄4-ton truck and trailer are convenient for any beef operation. A truck also is useful for transporting and dispersing hay.


Feeding beef cattle:
Unlike humans, cattle have a ruminant digestive system. Their stomachs are made up of four parts. Ruminant microorganisms in the first three parts enable cattle to digest fibrous feeds that humans cannot. This microbial breakdown produces essential nutrients such as amino acids and B vitamins. The presence of these nutrients makes beef very useful for human consumption
Nutritional needs - Cattle require protein, energy, water, fat, minerals, and vitamins. The amounts vary according to environment, the cow’s age, time of year, and production goals. Availability of feedstuffs also varies by location and season. Up to 75 percent of the cost of raising an animal goes to feed. Protein and carbohydrate levels adequate for growth and maintenance normally are found in high-quality legume hay, such as alfalfa and clover. Poor-quality feeds, such as cereal straw, grass straw, or rain-damaged hay, require protein or energy supplements. You can purchase supplements from your feed supplier. Beef cattle normally do not need vitamin A, B, or E supplementation. They can get these vitamins from normal-quality feedstuffs. However, a vitamin A deficiency can result from feeding dry, bleached-out hay. Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency include watery eyes, rough hair coat, night blindness, and poor gains. Vitamin D is formed by the action of sunlight on animal tissues. If you confine your cattle to a barn or stall for extended periods of time, vitamin D deficiency may become a problem. Minerals are inorganic compounds that contribute to bones, teeth, protein, and lipid functions of the body. Minerals are provided through natural feeds and supplementation.
There are three main categories of mineral supplements:
•	Salt, which usually is sold as iodized salt and does not contain other minerals
•	Trace mineralized salt, which consists of a large percentage of salt and traces of some or all of the following: copper, iron, iodine, cobalt, manganese, selenium, and zinc
•	Mineral mixes, which usually contain major minerals such as calcium and phosphorus as well as trace minerals and some salt
You can provide supplements as licks or mix them into feed. The composition of needed salt or mineral supplements varies depending on your locale and feedstuffs. Clean water is essential and must be provided at all times. Under normal conditions, cattle consume 4 to 20 gallons of water per day depending on size, age, and weather. Heat dramatically increases water consumption.


Types of feed:
Feedstuffs are categorized as concentrates or roughages. Concentrates are high in digestible nutrients. Grains and protein supplements are examples of concentrates. Roughages are feedstuffs that are low in digestible nutrients. Examples of roughages include hay, pasture, and silage. The percentage of roughage and concentrate in beef cattle rations depends on the type of animal being fed. For example, feedlot steers are fed mostly grain and a little roughage, while bred cows may be wintered on good-quality roughage alone. Caution: High-quality legume hay such as alfalfa may cause bloat. As a general rule, beef cattle consume up to 3 pounds of feed per day for each 100 pounds of body weight. A 500-pound weaned calf, for example, will eat 15 pounds of high-quality alfalfa hay per day. Cattle usually weigh 600 to 700 pounds before they are placed on a high-grain (highenergy) ration. This diet is fed until slaughter weight is achieved. If you feed out cattle for slaughter, you can purchase feed or grow and mix it at home. If only a few animals are being finished, it may be more economical to purchase the mixed ration from a feed dealer. Growth promotants, including anabolic steroids (implants), may have a place in your operation. They are used widely in the industry and have been proven safe. Ionophores are feed additives that decrease rumen upset, increase feed efficiency, and increase daily gains. These chemicals can improve gain significantly; however, they do not compensate for poor management. Finishing rations and feeding cattle for slaughter are explained in detail in the CowCalf Management Guide and Cattle Producer’s Library.


Health problems:
Cattle of all ages—but particularly young, growing cattle—are subject to a variety of ailments. They range from mild conditions to severe infectious diseases that may cause death within 24 hours. The cost of caring for sick cattle can seriously reduce your profit margin. With the increasing need to cut production costs, good herd health care is very important for any beef operation. Prevention is the easiest and cheapest method of disease control. Clean sheds, lots, and feed and water troughs give disease less chance to get started. A sound vaccination program, parasite control, and frequent observation of the herd also help to reduce the occurrence of illness. You can recognize a sick animal first by its abnormal behavior or physical appearance. Droopy ears, loss of appetite, head down, scouring (diarrhea), or inactivity may indicate illness. A high temperature usually indicates disease. The best course of action is to find a sick animal quickly, treat it, and then work to eliminate the cause of the sickness. If one or two animals come down with a disease, the rest of the herd has been or will be exposed to it. Health problems are more common during and after periods of stress, including calving, weaning, shipping, working or moving the cattle, and extreme weather conditions. Stress can reduce an animal’s ability to resist infectious agents. After a period of stress, give extra attention to your animals’ health.

Common cattle diseases:
The following are five of the more common health problems that beef producers encounter. You also need to be aware of other diseases that affect the health of livestock in your region.
Respiratory diseases - Respiratory diseases are common in cattle. A number of factors contribute to an outbreak: inadequate nutrition, stress, and viral or bacterial infection. Good management and vaccination of cows and calves is the best way to prevent outbreaks of respiratory disease. Your veterinarian or Extension agent can help you develop a program to reduce losses on your ranch and in the feedlot.
White muscle disease - White muscle disease is a serious problem in many areas of the Pacific Northwest. It is caused by a dietary deficiency of the trace mineral selenium. It may cause paralysis of the skeletal muscles or may affect the heart muscle, causing respiratory distress and death within a few hours. If you are in an area where white muscle disease is likely to occur, supply adequate amounts of selenium in the diet. In addition, injecting newborn calves with a commercial selenium/vitamin E preparation is a short-term solution. Your veterinarian can advise you regarding the incidence of disease in your area
Brucellosis (Bang’s disease) - Brucellosis (Bang’s disease) is a serious disease. It causes abortion and sterility in cattle, bison, elk, and deer, and undulant fever in humans. Federal and state laws effectively outline brucellosis control. Vaccination is required for all heifers. Brucellosis most commonly enters a herd through the purchase of infected cattle. To help prevent brucellosis from entering your herd, vaccinate all heifers between ages 4 to 10 months, and purchase only brucellosisvaccinated cattle.
External parasites - External parasites include horn flies, face flies, stable flies, heel flies, and lice. The largest health problem comes from the additional stress these insects cause to animals. When infested, cattle spend more time in the shade and don’t graze, which causes poor performance. You can reduce these problems by using fly-repellent ear tags or another parasite control treatment. Eliminating the areas where pests reproduce also helps to reduce the severity of external parasites.
Internal parasites - Internal parasites such as roundworms, lungworms, and liver flukes commonly occur in cattle. These hidden parasites cause poor performance and occasionally kill young animals. Cattle are likely to pick up internal parasites when they graze established pastures. Internal parasites also can be a problem in confined areas. Invasion of the stomach or intestinal wall by a parasite leads to poor digestion of nutrients and damage to organs. Signs of parasite infestation include scouring, rough hair coat, poor gains, and potbelly appearance. Use dewormers at strategic times during the year to reduce the numbers of internal parasites. Use fecal sampling to determine the severity of the infestation and the type of dewormer that will be effective.


Disease control:
Vaccinations and parasite controls are available for many of the diseases affecting cattle. The choice of remedy and time of application depend on a variety of things, including the animal’s nutritional level, disease prevalence in the herd, and the region in which the cattle are located. Refer to the Cow-Calf Management Guide and Cattle Producer’s Library for more information on beef cattle health problems, their prevention, and treatment. You also should consult a veterinarian and Extension agent to develop a sound health program for your herd.

Marketing:
It may not be easy to determine how and where to market your animals. The choice of market outlet depends on the class and grade of the cattle. Thus, the method of marketing usually is different for fed cattle, feeder, or purebred cattle. There are many different methods of marketing cattle, but most livestock in the United States are marketed through one of three channels: direct, auction, or carcass grade and weight basis. The direct and auction markets are for both fed and feeder cattle, while the carcass grade and weight basis is primarily for fed cattle. Purebred cattle usually are sold at special
Direct marketing (country dealers) - Direct selling, or country selling, refers to sales of livestock directly to packers, local dealers, or farmers without the use of agents or brokers. The sale usually takes place on the farm, ranch, feedlot, or some other nonmarket buying station or collection yard. This method does not involve a recognized market. Sellers who direct-market should be aware of possible regulations regarding the private sale of breeding animals or beef for consumption.
Niche marketing - A producer often can develop a local or regional market for certain cuts of beef or specialty beef products. If this interests you, check into meat handling requirements, inspections, and permits that may be necessary. This type of marketing usually takes time to develop and also may require a consistent seasonal or yearly supply.
Auction marketing - Livestock auctions or sales barns are trading centers where animals are sold by public bidding to the buyer who offers the highest price per hundredweight or per head. Auctions may be owned by individuals, partnerships, corporations, or cooperative associations.




What is diarrhoea and what causes it?
Diarrhoea (purging, scours) can have many causes.
Possible causes include bacterial and viral infections, certain chemicals, intestinal parasites, poor diet, overfeeding on milk or lush grass, poisonous plants and other toxins, food allergies and even stress.
In diarrhoea, the intestine fails to adequately absorb fluids, and/or secretion into the intestine is increased. Loss of fluids through diarrhoea produces dehydration and the loss of certain body salts.
It causes a change in body tissue composition and severe depression in the animal.
Death from scours is usually the result of dehydration and loss of body salts rather than invasion of an infectious agent.
The correct determination of the cause of diarrhoea is important in order to take effective preventive measures.


Some conditions are always accompanied by marked diarrhoea
Poisoning by arsenic or plants such as tulp, chincherinchee, slangkop and certain cereals contaminated with moulds.
Worm infection, e.g. conical fluke.
Infectious diseases, e.g. coccidiosis, salmonellosis, colibacillosis, Johne’s disease or paratuberculosis.

Worm infection, e.g. conical fluke.
Infectious diseases, e.g. coccidiosis, salmonellosis, colibacillosis, Johne’s disease or paratuberculosis.

When is diarrhoea very risky?  diarrhoea is very risky when Calf diarrhoea can cause a greater financial loss to cow/calf producers than any other disease-related problem they encounter. The age of the animal is very important. The younger the animal, the greater the chance of death. Many diarrhoea cases can be directly related to a lack of colostrum intake by the newborn calf.A calf that consumes 750 ml to 1½ l  colostrum in the first few hours after birth will absorb an adequate number of antibodies and therefore will be less susceptible to infections that can cause diarrhoea.



Diarrhoea in calves
Viral diarrhoea
Rotavirus diarrhoea: Within 24 hours of birth, a germ called rotavirus causes this type of diarrhoea. Infected calves are severely depressed. There may be drooling of saliva and watery diarrhoea.The faeces will vary in colour from yellow to green.Calves lose appetite and the death rate may be as high as 50 %.There are no signs on dead animals; however, there is an increased volume of fluid in both the small and large intestine.
Coronavirus diarrhoea: This occurs in calves that are over 5 days of age; the germ is called coronavirus.The animal is not as depressed as in rotavirus diarrhoea.The initial signs may be the same as in rotavirus, but later on the faeces may contain clear mucus that resembles the white of an egg.Mortality is low (1–25 %).
Bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD): 	Diarrhoea begins 2 to 3 days after exposure to the germ and may persist for a long time. Ulcers on the tongue, lips and in the mouth are the usual lesions found in the live calf. Bovine virus diarrhoea is controlled by vaccinating all replacement heifers 1 to 2 months before breeding.Pregnant heifers should not be vaccinated. Consult your state veterinarian before starting a BVD vaccination programme.
